# Pair-Programming
Pair Programming Activity is an activity for students currently taking Programming Principles I or II take the coding reins while students in advanced courses guide them verbally. The objective is clear: collabortive learning. Beginner srudents gain hands-on experience while advanced peers offer guidance. It's an oppuntunity to mprove technical skills and teamwork. 

A Little bit about me, I am a officer of Tech Developers Assocation at Georgia Southern University at Armstrong Campus. This is not necessarily a project but it is an activity I thought would be an amazing experience for students to come together.
